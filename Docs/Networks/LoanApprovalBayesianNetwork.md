## Methods



// Start Generation Here
### LearnParameters

**Summary**: Learns the parameters for the model.

**Parameters**:

- `trainingData`: The training data.

**Returns**: void

This method sets the observed values in the model and prepares arrays for all variables from the training data.

### AnalyzeFeatureImportance

**Summary**: Analyzes the feature importance of the model.

**Parameters**:

- `borrowerProfile`: The borrower profile.

**Returns**: FeatureImportance

This method calculates the base approval probability and then tests the impact of changes to each feature on the approval probability.

### FallbackHeuristicPrediction

**Summary**: Provides a fallback heuristic prediction for loan approval.

**Parameters**:

- `borrowerProfile`: The borrower profile.

**Returns**: double

This method uses a simple heuristic model that uses common lending guidelines.

### DirectParameterEstimation

**Summary**: Direct parameter estimation.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: void

This method is a fallback method for parameter estimation when full Bayesian inference fails. It uses direct statistical methods to approximate the model parameters.

### GenerateApprovalReport

**Summary**: Generates an approval report for a borrower profile.

**Parameters**:

- `borrowerProfile`: The borrower profile.

**Returns**: string

This method generates an approval report for a borrower profile.
