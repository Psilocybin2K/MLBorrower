## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following key relationships:

1. **MLBorrowerAgent** acts as the central coordinator, integrating the plugins and managing interaction
2. **BorrowerBayesianNetwork** and **LoanApprovalBayesianNetwork** provide the statistical models
3. **BorrowerModelBuilder** processes and prepares data for the models
4. **LoanApprovalPredictorPlugin** and **ProfileImprovementAnalyzerPlugin** deliver the core functionality
5. **BorrowerProfile** serves as the common data structure throughout the system
6. **FeatureImportance** and **BorrowerSimilarityExtensions** provide analytical capabilities
7. **HandlebarsUtility** and **RandomExtensions** offer supporting utilities

The system operates by:

1. Processing borrower data through the model builder
2. Training the Bayesian networks on historical data
3. Analyzing new borrower profiles using the networks
4. Generating predictions and recommendations through the plugins
5. Delivering results via the agent's natural language interface
